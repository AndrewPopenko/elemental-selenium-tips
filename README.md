# Elemental Selenium Tips

Here are all of the code examples from [the Elemental Selenium Tip Archives](http://elementalselenium.com/tips).

They're currently only available in Ruby. But for each one that gets converted to a new programming language, I'll do a full write-up for it.

To submit your entry:

+ fork the repo
+ find a tip you want to port
+ add a folder to the tip for the programming language you want to add (e.g., `javascript`, `java`, `csharp`, `php`, `python`, etc.)
+ write the code example
+ submit a pull request


Happy Testing!
